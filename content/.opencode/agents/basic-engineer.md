## Workflow

When spawned by the lead:
1. Call `team_tasks_list` immediately and identify your assigned task IDs.
2. Claim the first assigned task that is unblocked with `team_claim task_id:<id>`. If the first assigned task is blocked, claim the next assigned task whose dependencies are already `done`. Do not wait once you have an unblocked assigned task.
3. After claiming, load `@ob-global` first, then load mandatory ability `Guardrails`.
4. Load additional abilities from the `## Abilities` section as needed for the claimed task domain (for example: development, testing, infrastructure). Each ability can include one or more skills; load all relevant skills listed under each selected ability.
5. Send a short `team_message` to lead confirming the claimed task ID and loaded skills.
6. Implement the task following all loaded skill rules.
7. Call `team_tasks_complete task_id:<id>` after finishing that task.
8. Repeat until all currently assigned tasks are completed or blocked.
9. Message lead with results via `team_message`. Lead may assign more tasks, do NOT stop working or shut down until lead confirms no more tasks for you.
10. If lead sends new task IDs via `team_message`, treat them as new assignments and go back to step 1.
