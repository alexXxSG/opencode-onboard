Implement tasks from an OpenSpec change using the ensemble agent team.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` to get available changes and use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., `/opsx-apply <other>`).

2. **Check status to understand the schema**

   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - Which artifact contains the tasks (typically "tasks" for spec-driven, check status for others)

3. **Get apply instructions**

   ```bash
   openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   This returns:
   - `contextFiles`: artifact ID -> array of concrete file paths (varies by schema - could be proposal/specs/design/tasks or spec/tests/implementation/docs)
   - Progress (total, complete, remaining)
   - Task list with status
   - Dynamic instruction based on current state

   **Handle states:**
   - If `state: "blocked"` (missing artifacts): show message, suggest using openspec-continue-change
   - If `state: "all_done"`: congratulate, suggest archive with `/opsx-archive`
   - Otherwise: proceed to implementation

4. **Read context files**

   Read every file path listed under `contextFiles` from the apply instructions output.
   Do NOT tell agents to read files themselves, summarize the content here and pass it in spawn prompts.

5. **Show current progress**

   Display:
   - Schema being used
   - Progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - Remaining tasks overview

5b. **Scope & cost confirmation gate**

   Before spawning any agents, always run this check:

   1. Count remaining (incomplete) tasks from the apply instructions output.
   2. Classify cost tier:
      - **Low**: 1–3 tasks — short session, fast models likely sufficient
      - **Medium**: 4–7 tasks — meaningful cost, consider splitting across sessions
      - **High**: 8+ tasks — significant cost, strongly consider splitting the change
   3. Run `/quota` if the opencode-quota plugin is available to surface current budget state.
   4. **Always announce** before proceeding: cost tier, remaining task count, and current quota (if available).
   5. If cost tier is **Medium or High** (≥ 4 remaining tasks): use **AskUserQuestion tool** to ask the user: "About to spawn agents for N tasks (cost tier: MEDIUM/HIGH). Continue with implementation? (yes/no)"
      - If **no**: stop here. Suggest splitting the change into smaller pieces with `openspec` or reducing scope. Do not proceed to step 6.
      - If **yes**: proceed to step 6.
   6. If cost tier is **Low** (≤ 3 tasks): proceed automatically to step 6 (no confirmation needed).

6. **Implement via ensemble team**

   NEVER implement tasks directly. Always delegate to engineer workers via ensemble.
   Do NOT touch any source files before the team is running, not even a single edit.

   Steps MUST be followed in order. Do not skip any step.

   **Step 6a.** Create feature branch if not already on one: `feature/{id}-{slug}`

   **Step 6b.** Create the team:
      ```
      team_create "<change-name>-<random 4 digit number>"
      ```
      Announce: "Team running. Monitor at http://localhost:4747/"

   **Step 6c.** Add ALL tasks to the shared board BEFORE spawning anyone, using as many `team_tasks_add` calls as needed to wire dependencies correctly.
      Schema: { content: string, priority: "high"|"medium"|"low", depends_on?: string[] }
      You cannot reference returned task IDs until an earlier `team_tasks_add` call finishes, so add tasks in dependency order.
      ```
      team_tasks_add tasks:[
        { content: "1.1 <exact task text from tasks.md>", priority: "high" },
        { content: "1.2 <exact task text>", priority: "high" }
      ]
      ```
      Save the returned IDs for root tasks.
      ```
      team_tasks_add tasks:[
        { content: "2.1 <task that depends on 1.1>", priority: "high", depends_on: ["<real-id-of-1.1>"] },
        { content: "3.1 <task that depends on 1.2>", priority: "medium", depends_on: ["<real-id-of-1.2>"] }
      ]
      ```
      Repeat until every OpenSpec task is on the board, then pass the literal IDs returned by those calls to agents in step 6d.
      DO NOT call team_claim yourself, only agents claim tasks.
      DO NOT proceed to 6d until team_tasks_add succeeds.

   **Step 6d.** Discover available engineers, assign an INITIAL BATCH of tasks, then spawn workers.

       **ROLLING BATCH MODEL:**
       Agents do NOT receive all their tasks upfront. Instead:
       - Assign each agent an initial batch of up to 3 unblocked tasks.
       - When an agent completes its batch and messages back, the lead assigns the next batch of up to 3 unassigned tasks from the board that match the agent's domain.
       - Repeat until no pending tasks remain on the board.
       - Only shut down an agent when the board has no more tasks for its domain.

       Before spawning:
       - scan `.opencode/agents/` and list the engineers that actually exist in this project
       - exclude `devops-manager` from implementation selection
       - read each engineer's description and abilities
       - prefer the most specialized custom engineer whose description and abilities match the task
       - use `basic-engineer` only when no custom engineer is a clear fit or as a recovery fallback
       - never spawn an engineer name that is not present in `.opencode/agents/`

       REQUIRED assignment algorithm (do not skip):
       1. Build candidate list from `.opencode/agents/*.md` excluding `devops-manager`.
       2. Classify each task by domain using task text (api/backend, ui/frontend, infra/devops, testing/qa).
       3. For each task, score every candidate agent:
          - +3 if agent description explicitly matches domain
          - +2 if agent `## Abilities` include domain-relevant skills
          - +1 if prior tasks of same domain already assigned to that agent (cohesion)
       4. Assign task to highest-score agent.
       5. Use `basic-engineer` ONLY when no specialized agent has positive score.
       6. If all tasks go to `basic-engineer`, you MUST explain why no specialist matched.

       HARD RULES:
       - NEVER assign a task to `basic-engineer` if a specialized agent has higher score.
       - NEVER skip agent discovery from `.opencode/agents/*.md`.
       - ALWAYS include assignment rationale only when it changes task routing or is needed to justify using `basic-engineer`.

       Skill loading is worker-driven:
       - The spawned agent MUST load `@ob-global` first.
       - Then it MUST load skills from its own `## Abilities` for the claimed task domain.

       Each team_spawn MUST include the agent field (required, causes NOT NULL error if omitted).

       The spawn prompt must be short and operational. It must contain:
       1. Their name and engineer file on this team
       2. Their initial batch of tasks (up to 3): include the LITERAL task IDs AND the task content. Copy them verbatim from the IDs returned by `team_tasks_add`. Do NOT paraphrase or omit IDs.
       3. Key context they need, summarized from context files
       4. Exact verification commands or acceptance checks
       5. Only the mandatory skill names or repo-specific rules they still need after claim

       Keep spawn prompts short and concrete. Prefer 120-220 tokens. Do NOT paste a generic tool list or long workflow boilerplate the plugin and agent file already provide.
       ALWAYS set `claim_task` to the first unblocked task in that agent's initial batch.
       Only spawn agents whose tasks are actually needed by this change. Skip agents with no tasks.

       Prompt shape:
       ```
       You are <worker-name>, <engineer-file>.
       Claim this task immediately as your first action:
       - [task-<id1>] <task text>
       <optional more tasks in the batch>

       Key context:
       - <short bullets>

       After claiming:
       1. Load @ob-global
       2. Load only the relevant abilities/skills for this task
       3. Implement the task
       4. Call team_tasks_complete for the same task ID
       5. Send a short team_message with files changed and checks run
       ```

       Spawn sequentially, waiting for each result:
       ```
       team_spawn name:"ui1" agent:"frontend-engineer" prompt:"..."
       (wait for result)
       team_spawn name:"api1" agent:"backend-engineer" prompt:"..."
       (wait for result)
       ```
       Replace example agent names with REAL engineers that exist in this project.

       Then send each spawned worker a short start message that repeats their exact task IDs if needed:
       ```
       team_message to:"ui1" text:"Claim now: [task-<id1>] <task text>."
       ```
       Never send a generic "claim your first task" message without the actual IDs.
       If `claim_task` already covers the first task, keep the start message minimal. Use follow-up messages mainly for additional tasks in the batch or recovery.

   **Step 6e.** After sending start messages, tell the user what is running, then STOP and wait.
       Do NOT call team_results, team_status, or team_broadcast in a loop.
       Teammates will message you when done or blocked. Wait for those messages.
       Tell the user exactly how to inspect progress:
       - `team_status` for team snapshot
       - `team_tasks_list` for board state
       - `team_view member:"<name>"` for a teammate live session
       - `team_results from:"<name>"` for full teammate report text

   **Step 6f.** When a teammate messages back (rolling re-assignment loop):
       1. Call `team_results from:"<name>"` to read full message.
       2. Call `team_tasks_list` to check remaining pending/unassigned tasks on the board.
       3. If the teammate is idle and has not claimed any assigned task:
          - resend one short claim-only message with the same literal task IDs
          - if they still do not claim, `team_shutdown member:"<name>" force:true`
          - respawn once with a shorter prompt and the same first `claim_task`
          - if the second spawn also stays idle, stop forcing ensemble for this change and continue in the main session or ask the user whether to retry later
       4. **If there are more unassigned tasks matching this agent's domain:**
          - Pick up to 3 unassigned, unblocked tasks for this agent's domain.
          - Send them via `team_message to:"<name>" text:"Claim next: [task-<id1>] <desc>, [task-<id2>] <desc>."`
          - Do NOT shut down the agent. Go back to waiting (step 6e).
       5. **If no more tasks for this agent:**
          - `team_shutdown member:"<name>"`
          - `team_merge member:"<name>"`
          - If team_merge blocks on local changes: `git stash`, retry merge, `git stash pop`.
       6. **If ALL agents are shut down and tasks remain unassigned** (new domain, dependencies unblocked):
          - Discover the remaining matching engineers from `.opencode/agents/` and spawn a new wave (back to step 6d).
       7. **If ALL tasks are done:** proceed to step 7.

       **ZERO PENDING TASKS GUARANTEE:** Before proceeding to step 7, call `team_tasks_list` and verify EVERY task is either `done` or `blocked`. If any task is `pending` and unassigned, assign it to an agent or spawn a new one. Never leave pending tasks orphaned.

7. **Verification check**

   Spawn the best available verification-capable engineer with `worktree:false` (for example, a testing-focused custom engineer or `basic-engineer` if no better verifier exists):
   ```
   team_spawn name:"verify" agent:"<real-verifier-engineer>" worktree:false prompt:"<verification scope, context summary, run tests + build + lint + verify acceptance criteria, no task claiming required in this phase, send results to lead when done>"
   ```
   Wait for message -> team_results -> fix blockers -> team_shutdown (no team_merge needed, worktree:false)

8. **Mark tasks complete in openspec**

   Update tasks.md: `- [ ]` → `- [x]` for each completed task.
   Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` to confirm.

9. **Show status, then cleanup**

   Display:
   - Tasks completed this session
   - Overall progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - If all done: suggest archive with `/opsx-archive`
   - If paused: explain why and wait for guidance

   Then run `team_cleanup`.

**Guardrails**
- NEVER skip or reorder steps 6a-6f
- NEVER skip step 5b scope & cost check before spawning
- NEVER spawn agents for Medium or High cost sessions (≥4 tasks) without explicit user confirmation from step 5b
- ALWAYS run `/quota` at session start (step 5b) when the opencode-quota plugin is available
- NEVER implement tasks directly. Always use team_create + team_spawn, no exceptions
- NEVER touch source files before team_create is called, not even one edit
- NEVER call team_spawn without the agent field, it is required and will fail without it
- NEVER call team_spawn before all tasks are on the board; use multiple `team_tasks_add` calls when dependencies require real IDs from earlier calls
- NEVER poll team_results or team_status in a loop, wait for teammates to message you
- NEVER call team_claim or team_tasks_complete as lead, only agents call these tools
- NEVER leave pending tasks orphaned, always verify board is empty before proceeding to step 7
- ALWAYS pass the LITERAL task IDs returned by team_tasks_add into each agent's spawn prompt, copy the exact IDs, never paraphrase
- ALWAYS assign initial batch of up to 3 tasks per agent; re-assign next batch (up to 3) via team_message when agent reports done
- ALWAYS call team_tasks_list after each agent reports done to check for remaining unassigned tasks
- ALWAYS repeat the same literal task IDs in any task assignment message, never send a generic "claim your first task" without the actual IDs
- NEVER send a start message that omits task IDs; if a task ID is missing from the start message, the agent cannot claim
- NEVER edit files between team_spawn and team_merge, team_merge blocks on overlapping local changes
- ALWAYS add every task to the board before spawning, using multiple `team_tasks_add` calls when dependency wiring requires it
- ALWAYS discover engineers from `.opencode/agents/` and prefer matching custom engineers over `basic-engineer`
- ALWAYS spawn agents sequentially (wait for each team_spawn result before the next), then send start messages to all of them together
- ALWAYS set `claim_task` for the first unblocked task in each initial batch and instruct agents to claim before any other work
- ALWAYS shut down + merge agents only when no more tasks remain for their domain
- If teammates are stuck, use one short claim-only message, then one respawn with a shorter prompt. If repeated idle/stall continues, stop forcing ensemble and continue outside it.
- Mark tasks complete in openspec AFTER worker implementation and verification finish, not before
- Pause on errors, blockers, or unclear requirements. Do not guess
- Use contextFiles from CLI output, do not assume specific file paths
- Follow CLI rules from `@ob-global` when present
