## When used

- No other skill matches the user's request
- Task is unclear or ambiguous
- Load ob-global first for baseline rules

## Approach

1. **Understand the ask**, Clarify if ambiguous
2. **Check existing context**, Read DESIGN.md, ARCHITECTURE.md first
3. **Start small**, MVP, iterate
4. **Verify**, Run tests + build before claiming done
5. **Report results**, Show what was done, what remains

## Communication

- Ask for clarification if unclear
- Report blockers immediately
- Show progress when asked
